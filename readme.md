# 🚀 LLM Input Safety Classifier 🛡️

This project provides a robust classification tool designed to **protect LLMs** from harmful or unethical prompts, ensuring responsible usage and alignment with ethical standards.

---

## 🔍 Why This Classifier?

Our LLM Input Classifier:
- **Safeguards LLM interactions** by identifying **safe** and **unsafe prompts**.
- Recognizes **various attack methods** embedded in prompts, such as targeted adversarial attacks or attempts to manipulate model responses.
- Categorizes input prompts across labels like **non-attack**, **TAP**, **PAIR**, **PAP**, and others, helping you understand input intent and possible risks.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Identify unsafe prompts**: Detect prompts that may lead to harmful, unethical, or unintended outputs.
- **Classify attack types**: Recognize specific types of attacks and categorize them accordingly, enabling better control and moderation.
- **Enable responsible LLM usage**: Ensure prompts align with safe usage guidelines and prevent exploitation or misuse.

## 📊 Benefits

- **Improved model robustness** by filtering out unsafe prompts.
- **Enhanced model alignment** with ethical standards and regulatory compliance.
- **Effective prompt monitoring** for real-time or batch processing, supporting safer AI interactions.
